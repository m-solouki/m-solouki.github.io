I am a Ph.D. graduate in Control and Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Torino, specializing in Design for Test (DFT), Fault Tolerance, and Reliability in embedded systems. My research focused on developing software solutions to enhance system reliability and functional safety (ISO 26262), particularly for automotive and industrial applications.

-Developed Software-Implemented Hardware Fault Tolerance (SIHFT) methods for detecting Control Flow Errors (CFEs) caused by Random Hardware Failures (RHFs) in embedded systems.
-Integrated CFE detection techniques into model-based software design, improving real-time execution efficiency.
-Proposed a classification scheme for permanent hardware faults to aid in ISO 26262 compliance.

I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Qazvin Islamic Azad University, where I researched the impact of process variations on Phase Change Memory (PCM) systems and proposed mitigation strategies. My B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Islamic Azad University of Mashhad involved investigating challenges in VoIP services and protocol design.

Technical Skills:
Programming Languages: C/C++, MATLAB
Hardware Description Language: Verilog HDL

Professional Interests:
Design for Test (DFT) 
Fault Tolerance & Reliability Engineering
Functional Safety (ISO 26262) Compliance
Dependable Embedded Systems
Software Testing & Verification

I am committed to advancing DFT methodologies to improve the reliability and safety of embedded systems in the automotive and semiconductor sectors.
